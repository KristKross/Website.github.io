                One of the best characters in the game, Plague Doctor is a staple in almost
                every party. Due to her kit she excels in different roles. She can be great in a support 
                role but not in the conventional way. What she's known for is her powerful control abilites 
                and damage over-time. She can pretty much neutralize the enemy backline with her Blinding 
                Gas and Disorienting Blast. When it comes to her trinkets, usually players opt for ones that 
                increase stun chance. Overall, Plague Doctor is one of the best characters in Darkest Dungeon.

            <div class="text">
                If you are looking for a dedicated healer to join your party, Vestal might be what you need 
                as her kit includes both single target as well as whole party healing. It doesn't matter if 
                you are facing endgame content or you just started playing, she's equally good at what she 
                does. That said, healing is all she brings to a team. Because of that, she really has no 
                place in teams that want to mitigate damage in other ways, for example with heavy crowd 
                control skills. She's S+ tier for new players, though.

            <div class="text">
                Helion is an offensive juggernaut. She can be a part of pretty much any party, as all she 
                really needs is to be in the first position. Put her there and let her deal tons of damage 
                with high crits and bleeds that can reach the enemy back line. She doesn't enjoy fights 
                that go on for a long time, but once she crits and goes on a rampage, everything dies fast. 
                Simply an overpowered adventurer that deserves the spot at the top of the Darkest Dungeon tier list.

            <div class="text">
                Even though many players dislike generalist adventurers for the most part, Houndmaster is a hero that 
                can work well in certain party formations, mostly from the 2nd, 3rd or 4th position. As a support unit, 
                his toolkit revolves around buffing his allies. His skill Target Whistle can mark targets and reduce 
                their PROT is always useful along with his camp abilities. In terms of damage dealing, Houndmaster 
                relies on bleed that causes damage over time, even though it's not really that strong. Because of his 
                bonus against Beast enemies, he's highly effective in the Warrens.

                Arbalest and Musketeer are essentially the same heroes. Musketeer is a visual redesign of Arbalest that 
                was initially available only to 'Adventure tier' Kickstarter donators. The only difference between these 
                two are their unique shard trinkets, so it makes sense to rank them together. Even though they are 
                considered to be damage dealers, they are more of a support unit that adds utility to the team. 
                Battlefield Bandage ability can boost the healing a hero receives, making them a great pair with dedicated 
                healers such as Vestal or Occultist.

                Crusader is what you call a jack of all trades. Even though he's considered to be a tank, he brings a lot 
                to the table. His kit includes crowd control abilities, stress healing as well as HP healing. And, of 
                course, he has decent damage output with skills such as Zealous Accusation, Smite and Stunning Blow. His 
                Holy Lance ability allows him to jump right back to the frontline in case he was moved. His bonus damage 
                against unholy targets makes him a staple for any party that wants to go through the Ruins. Even though is 
                a generalist adventurer, Crusader is definitely top tier.

                can mark and stun targets and can also move around the formation easily thanks to his movement skills. 
                Because of that, he's a great fit to a party that aims to shuffle adventurers positions.

                such as Jester and get certain trinkets. That said, these trinkets won't come easily during the early stages.

                A frontline healer who can inflict bleed to pretty much any enemy regardless of position. Problem is, he also 
                likes to be dangerously low on HP to get the most out of his kit. You need to constantly pay attention to his HP.
                 Too much healing means no buffs, but leaving him on low-HP can also result in death. He has great synergy with 
                 heroes like Plague Doctor and Antiquarian and he's certainly a unique adventurer. That said, Flagellant isn't 
                 exactly what you would call a beginner-friendly hero. So if you just started playing the game, maybe you'll find 
                 his play style somewhat confusing.

                Occultist is one of the most versatile adventurers in the game. He can be played either as a damage dealer or a 
                dedicated healer, or even a support hero with his crowd control and debuff abilities. Because of that, Occultist 
                can easily fit into various teams. That said, most players opt to use Occultist in a healer role. Due to his RNG 
                healing mechanics (sometimes you might roll 0), he works great with adventurers that provide some type of healing.

                Highwayman is all about doing damage to his enemies. If you are familiar with RPGs, then you probably know what a

                overall survivability. And that's what Highwayman is. He's an excellent damage dealer with great reach, but lower 
                than average health pool and little to no defenses. While he's very good at doing damage, that's really his only 
                contribution to a team.

                to all party members. On the offensive, Jester relies on bleed to do damage, but he really needs certain 
                adventurers with him to be effective in that role as he wants to be locked in 3rd position.

                that he can only transform once per battle, plus the disadvantage of a stress penalty to all party members 
                whenever he switches to his beast form, makes Abomination a bad fit for most team comps.

                An adventurer with high Crit and Dodge base numbers but somewhat low-HP, Grave Robber lies somewhere between

                 team comps that like to rotate the heroes' position, and she has great synergy with certain heroes. That said, 
                 she's not as good in other situations. Also, her cheap camp skills are notable and she has a good trinket set 
                 for the most part.

                traditional support like Vestal, as she can't be the primary healer of your team, but she can boost your party's 
                Dodge stat, raise their resistances or lower enemies ACC. Of course, her ability to raise the amount of gold you 
                earn is what really makes her stands out.
