            <h1>About the designer</h1>
            <p> I am an avid fan of the roguelike genre, from Hades, Slay the Spire, Darkest Dungeons, and the like. I enjoy the difficulty
                and tactile design of this genre, the permanent death aspect allows the player to keep redefining new ways to combat past
                deaths and overcome it with a feeling of accomplishments, that feeling alone is what pulled me into the rogue like genre.
                <br><br>
                I created this website as both a university and a passion project. I have only been learning HTML through what I have been taught 
                in lectures, and I am not a great designer. I am more interested in the coding fundamentals and technical aspects of computing, but 
                I can still enjoy the particulars of design.
